# Feature-Selection-Regularization-Exercise
In this exercise I explore the relationships between the physical characteristics and specific skills of soccer players on their overall performance using a sample data set. I use cross-validation in order to implement a backwards search for important features and explore regularization in both Lasso and Ridge Regression schemes.
I use the data file "footballer_small.csv" for my analysis.
